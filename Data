Data:
We will be using foursquare data for the city of Chicago, IL.  With foursquare, we can find neighborhoods that have access to 
city bike paths and how many resturants are located in that neighborhood.  We can cluster areas by type of restaurants nad make our 
decision about which neighborhood would be best for a vegan cyclist resturant.
