Data

Data Sources:
	Chicago neighborhoods along with their zip codes will be acquired from Wikipedia and 
  City of Chicago websites.  Finding Chicago's bike paths will be obtained through 
  Foursquare using the explore function.  Once the locations of the bike paths are acquired,
  we can use the coordinates and the Foursquare explore function again to get a query of restaurant 
  and shops within a 5 mile radius.  Once this data is obtained, we can cluster the different neighborhoods 
  and then determine which neighborhood will best best for the restaurant.

Data Cleaning:
	Data will be gathered from multiple sources, so there will need to be some data manipulation 
  in order to combine the data into one table.  As this is the beginning of the discussion, more will 
  be added in this section in the final report.
