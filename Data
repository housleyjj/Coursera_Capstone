Data:
We will be using foursquare data for the city of Chicago, IL.  With foursquare, we can find neighborhoods that have access to 
city bike paths.  Using the coordinates for the bike paths, we then can find the type of shops and restaurants in a radius of 5 miles.
We will be looking for neighborhoods that have bike shops and a variety of types of restaurants.  
We can cluster the neighborhoods around Chicago.  Within our different clusters, we can see the top ten restaurant cuisines.  
This will be important to determine if the location already has a restaurant of our type (vegan cuisine).
