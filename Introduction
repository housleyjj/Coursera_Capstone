Introduction:

Background:
	It is hard to open a new restaurant, especially one that caters to a specific community.  
  Selecting the correct location is a critical step in the initial set up of the restaurant, in order 
  to place it on the path of success.  It is of great importance  to select a location in order to 
  reach the community the restaurant wants to serve.

Problem:
	A client seeks to open a cyclist friendly restaurant, with a emphasis  
  on Mediterranean cuisine in a Chicago neighborhood.  The main question, which
  neighborhood would be best for the restaurant.

	The objective of this capstone is to locate the best neighborhood for this niche restaurant.  
  Using Foursquare API, we will be able to determine locations with access to city bike paths, 
  other restaurants and shops within a 5 mile radius of the bike path.

Interest:
	Others wanting to cater to the growing cyclist community will be interested in finding 
  potential neighborhoods in which business opportunities would be easier to establish.
