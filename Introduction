Overview:
The Problem: Where to open a restaurant.
With the growing interest in cycling culture, I will find a great neighborhood to open a restaurant that will be welcoming to the cyclist 
community of Chicago, IL.  May times cyclists would like to take a relaxed ride to bike friendly locations for light shopping and 
lunch.  The location will need to be close to access to a city bike path, shopping, and other restaurants.  This information will 
be of interest for potential investors that are interested in catering to the growing cyclist community.
